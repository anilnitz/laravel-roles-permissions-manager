## Laravel Roles Permissions Manager
<h5>Laravel Version : 8</h5>
<hr />

## Usage
This is not a package - it's a full Laravel project that you should use as a starter boilerplate, and then add your own custom functionality.

<ul>
    <li>Clone the repository with <code>git clone</code></li>
    <li>Copy <code>.env.example</code> file to <code>.env</code> and edit database credentials there</li>
    <li>Run <code>composer install</code></li>
    <li>Run <code>php artisan key:generate</code></li>
</ul>

With that user you can create more roles/permissions/users, and then use them in your code, by using functionality like Gate or @can, as in default Laravel.

<b>Your will be get Login Credentials from seeder file</b> <br>
--- &lt;root-project&gt; / database / seeders / UsersTableSeeder.php <br>
